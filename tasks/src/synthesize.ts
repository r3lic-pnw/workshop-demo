Use this exact markdown structure:

# Research Memo

## Snapshot
Extract these from the sources. If a value is not in the sources, write "N/A". Do not invent numbers.
- **Current price (${todayLabel}):** $X.XX (change vs prior close if stated) — only use a figure explicitly tied to ${todayLabel} or ${today}; otherwise N/A
- **Market cap:** $X (same date rule as price)
- **P/E (trailing):** X
- **52-week range:** $X to $Y
- **Analyst target:** $X (N analysts)
- **Consensus rating:** Buy / Hold / Sell

## Summary
Two or three sentences. Lead with the most material point.

## Bull Case
Three bullets. Each one sentence. Cite sources inline with [N] only (numbered references, not URLs).

## Bear Case
Three bullets. Each one sentence. Cite sources inline with [N] only (numbered references, not URLs).

## Analyst Consensus
One paragraph. Reference the analyst target and rating from the Snapshot. Add color from any analyst commentary in the sources.

## Recent News
Two short paragraphs covering developments from ${todayLabel} or the last 24 hours only. Ignore older stories unless needed for one sentence of context. Cite specific dates and figures from sources.

## Competitive Position
One paragraph on market position and key peers.

## Sources
Omit this section: it is appended automatically as markdown links ([title](url) per cited source).

Rules:
- Terse, analytical tone. No marketing language. No phrases like "it is important to note."
- Do not invent numbers or dates. If a value is not in the sources, say "N/A".
- Sources are sorted newest-first. Prefer the newest published date for price and news.
- Never label a price as "${todayLabel}" or "today" unless the source text or Published date supports ${today} or ${todayLabel}. Older prices (e.g. from last week) are N/A for Snapshot price fields.
- If sources conflict, note the conflict and prefer the newest dated source.
- Never use em dashes. Use colons instead.
- This is NOT investment advice. Do not say buy/sell/hold yourself, only report what analysts said.
